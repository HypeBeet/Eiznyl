Brett is the coolest kid in the school. He deserves all rights to this land. He's pretty Gucci...

Not really though.
There are a lot of people who are cooler than him.
Let me make a list...
  The rest of his class,
  the people in the class below them,
  the people in the class below them,
  all the way down to the Freshmen.
  Also the middle school.
  And the teachers(not Roaden though)(also including Fr. Tom).
